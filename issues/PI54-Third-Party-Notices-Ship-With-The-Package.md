  "covers": "the license and notice texts of what the executable compiles in - SnakeYAML, JSpecify, the agent API, the wire classes, the GraalVM runtime - in one THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES file, in the deb's doc directory and as `%license` in the rpm"
}
```

**What must be true.** Whoever installs `porelo-agent-pi` finds the license and notice texts of every third-party component
compiled into its executable in one file, `/usr/share/doc/porelo-agent-pi/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`, named in `debian/copyright` and
marked `%license` in the RPM.

## Why

`src/deb/copyright/copyright` says the executable is compiled from the program and porelo-wire's classes alone. It
holds more: read in a native executable built from `main`: SnakeYAML's, JSpecify's, porelo-agent-api's and the GraalVM runtime's (`com.oracle.svm`) classes are in it. Their licenses ask that their notices travel with the binary, and today
neither package carries them.

## The shape

- The file is made by the shared generator in porelo-buildtools' release tooling, which collects every compiled-in
  jar's `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` and the licenses they embed into one file with the full texts; the package build calls
  it through the plugin dependency it already has on `porelo-release`.
- The deb installs it in its doc directory and names it in `copyright`; the rpm marks it `%license`.
- The Pi tree keeps what it has: its stanza in `copyright`, its bill of materials and the license texts inside the tarball. This issue covers the executable only.
- Nothing is built before that generator is published from porelo-buildtools' `main`.

## Acceptance

- In a built package, the file names SnakeYAML, JSpecify, porelo-agent-api, porelo-wire and the GraalVM runtime,
  each with its full license text; `dpkg -L` and `rpm -qL` list it.
- A test fails when a runtime dependency in the package's bill of materials is missing from the file, so a new
  dependency cannot ship without its notice.

## To be checked

- Which notices the GraalVM runtime asks for in a native executable, and whether the generator gives them or they
  are added beside its output.
