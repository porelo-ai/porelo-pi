```

**Why this size.** one reader over the two events the formatter already reads, a name table and its tests; no background jobs to join. It builds against `ToolEvents`, which Porelo's agent API adds in its contract version 5;
nothing of that format is decided here.

**What must be true.** For every tool call the agent makes in a task, Porelo records one entry in its common
tool-call format: the task, the tool as the agent names it, its kind (shell, edit, read, search, web, sub-agent, mcp
or other), when it started and when it ended, for a shell call the program it started, and whether it ran in the
background; a background job's start and end are joined by its id. The adapter only maps its agent's own output into
that entry; the format, the time a line without its own time gets, and where the entry is kept are Porelo's.

## Plan

- Source: Pi's JSON mode (`--mode json`). `tool_execution_start` and `tool_execution_end`, joined by `toolCallId`, with `toolName` and `args`; `PiJsonFormatter` reads the same two events today.
- `PiAgent` overrides `Agent#toolEvents(String line)`, which the agent API's contract version 5 adds and AgentServer
  serves as `ToolEvents`; `PiToolEvents` maps one output line to its tool events (`id`, START or END, `tool`, `kind`,
  `program`, `background`, `jobId`, `at` where the line has a time). It keeps no state between lines: Porelo joins a
  start to its end by `id`, and a background job's by `jobId`.
- Kinds: `bash` -> shell (program from `args.command`), `edit`/`write` -> edit, `read` -> read, `grep`/`find`/`ls` -> search, any other (an extension's) -> other.
- The program of a shell call is the first word of its command line, after `env`, assignments and `sudo`; never the
  whole line, which can carry a secret.
- Background: Pi's built-in tools run in the foreground; a call is never background.
- Red first: `PiToolEventsTest` feeds a recorded run's lines (a shell call, an edit, an unknown tool, a failed call,
  and a line that is not JSON) and expects one start and one end per call, the kinds above and the program alone; it
  fails while `toolEvents` still answers the API's default, nothing.
- Level: unit tests over recorded output only; the acceptance legs show the entries of a real run once Porelo writes
  them.

## Acceptance

- A recorded unattended run yields one entry per tool call with tool, kind, start, end and, for a shell call, the
  program; a background job's start and end are one entry.
- No entry holds a command line beyond its program, a file's content or a tool's output.
- A line the reader cannot read yields nothing and never stops the run.

## Open questions

- Attended tasks: their agent runs at a terminal and writes no JSON stream. Should their tool calls be recorded too?
  That takes the agent's session files or hooks, a larger change for each adapter.
- The program of a shell call: is the first word enough, or should the entry keep the whole command line, which can
  carry a secret?

## To be checked

- Porelo's agent API with contract version 5 and `Agent#toolEvents`, installed locally to build against.
- Whether `tool_execution_start`/`_end` carry a time of their own in the pinned Pi, or only `message_end` does.
