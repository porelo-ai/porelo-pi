}
```

**Why this size.** the workflows and `settings.xml` of this one repository, no contract another repository reads; about
2 hours of work once porelo-claude-code has set the shape, plus the runs on the
local Forgejo.

**How it stands.** On a local Forgejo the Build, the shared rules and the workflow check run green, and the central forge's side is unchanged; what only a host shows is named below.

**What must be true.** `porelo-pi`'s workflows run green on the local Forgejo and on the central forge on the same
commit, with no edit between them: the machines its legs rent are asked for by kind, and the registry and the
provider are variables of the setup.

The machine kinds are porelo-buildtools' (`porelo-machines acceptance --kind amd64`).

## Plan

Read in today's `.github/workflows/`, `settings.xml` and `pom.xml`. The shape is the one porelo-message-sluice's workflows have, the
variables those of porelo-host's `doc/local-forge.md`, *The local registry and publication settings*.

- **What ties the Build to GitHub today:**
  - `settings.xml` reads snapshots from `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL` through the `forge` profile, and from Sonatype through the
    `standard` profile where that variable is unset; a tag's `-P!standard,!forge` reads none. From there come `porelo-bom`, `porelo-agent-api` and `porelo-wire` (`porelo.version`
    0.5.1-SNAPSHOT), `porelo-acceptance-kit` (`porelo.kit.version` 0.5.1-SNAPSHOT, profile `acceptance`), and `porelo-parent`,
    `porelo-release` and `porelo-machines`.
  - Publish and its index check, in the `build` and the `release` job of `build.yml`, take `vars.JF_URL` and
    `secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `artifactory-smoke.yml`, only where `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH` is `true`.
  - The `proof` job asks GitHub's API for a run that proved the tree (`proven-legs`, `github.token`), only where
    `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH` is `true`.
  - The acceptance legs (`build.yml`'s *Acceptance on …*, `update.yml`'s two legs) pass `PORELO_MACHINES_API` and
    `PORELO_MACHINES_SSH` to `porelo-machines acceptance --kind amd64` and `sweep --mine`. `build.yml`'s `acceptance` job runs
    only where `github.server_url` is GitHub's; on `main` with `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH` `true` it installs the package last
    published to Artifactory, on a tag or elsewhere the one the run built.
  - `delete-runs.yml` calls `gh api`. In `update.yml`, *Open the pull request* pushes with GitHub's extra header and
    runs `gh pr` and `gh api`, *Merge, or say why not* runs `gh pr merge`, and *What else changed in the shipped tree*
    reads the published bill from Artifactory's fixed address. Both workflows run only where `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH` is
    `true`.
- **Where Porelo's snapshots come from on the local forge:** the `forge` profile replaces Sonatype, so the forge's
  registry must hold `porelo`'s Maven snapshots before this Build resolves there, while `porelo` itself moves last.
  `porelo`'s Build on the host's forge deploys them there (`forge-release`, as porelo-parent and
  porelo-buildtools do), its legs not moved yet, so a Porelo change made in a task can be built against before it
  reaches GitHub.
- **How it is tested:** locally against a Forgejo started in podman, with a Forgejo Actions runner and Forgejo's own
  package registry as `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL`, and against GitHub by the push. The pattern is the live check of
  porelo-forge-clients' `forgejo` client: the server and the runner images pinned by digest, the runner in the server's
  network, and only what the run created removed, after a failure too. That check uses no registry, so this run adds
  it; the registry starts empty, so the snapshots this Build resolves are deployed there first.
- **Steps:**
  1. `settings.xml` gains the `forge` profile and the `porelo-forge` server as porelo-message-sluice has them
     (activated by `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL`, the token from `PORELO_PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN`), and `standard` stays off where
     `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL` is set. A profile's activation takes one property only, so `-Dporelo.release` no longer
     turns the snapshot repositories off: a tag's `MAVEN_ARGS` adds `-P!standard,!forge`. Every Maven call passes
     both values through the step's `env`, since a workflow's `env` cannot read a secret: the `pinned-jdk` action's,
     those in `build.yml`, `update.yml`, `workflows.yml` and `shared-rules.yml`, and the `./mvnw verify` that
     `porelo-machines acceptance` starts on the runner for a leg's suite (its `acceptance` profile resolves
     `porelo-acceptance-kit`).
  2. `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH`, a variable of the organization already in place on the central forge, checked at the
     start to be `true` or `false`, switches what only the central forge does:
     Publish and its index check, the `release` job, `artifactory-smoke.yml`, `delete-runs.yml`, the `proof` job, and
     the whole of `update.yml`, which updates the central forge only. Where it is `false`, the legs install the packages
     this run built (the `packages` artifact, as a tag does today), so a leg never tests what Artifactory held before.
  3. The legs ask `porelo-machines acceptance --kind amd64` with `PORELO_MACHINES_API` and `PORELO_MACHINES_SSH`.
     Today the host's pool answers only to `--pool <file>` with `PORELO_POOL_SSH`, and `sweep --mine` asks the cloud
     provider alone; the job learns where the pool is from the forge's runner (`PORELO_MACHINES_POOL`, as porelo-host
     proposes it), so the same lines take a pool
     account on the forge and rent on GitHub. **On the host's forge the `acceptance` job is off while the
     repository moves:** it runs only where `github.server_url` is GitHub's, until the host's pool lends a
     forge job a machine by kind; [PI40](README.md#pi40) switches it on there.
  4. `porelo-release check-providers` joins the Build's checks in the same commit; the provider's names leave
     `build.md` and the machine type in `pi.yaml`'s comment too.
- **Red first:** the `build.yml` from before these changes on the local Forgejo, which stops at the snapshot resolution or
  at Publish; and `check-providers` on the tree from before them, which named the workflows and `build.md` and the machine type in `pi.yaml`'s comment.

- **Built on the central forge's side:** steps 1, 2 and 4 and step 3's GitHub half; `check-providers` was seen red on
  the tree before and green after, and a tag's `-P!standard,!forge` was measured to resolve no snapshot parent from an
  empty local repository, with `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL` set and without. The reading against `security-audit` and
  `clean-code` (2026.906.3) found nothing beyond what the same change's first reading declined: the `release` job's
  condition, a missing `PORELO_PUBLISH`, and the variable that switches the jobs calling GitHub's API.

## Acceptance

- Seen to fail first: the `build.yml` from before these changes on the local Forgejo.
- The same commit's Build green on the local Forgejo (the `acceptance` job skipped, nothing published) and on GitHub (legs
  rented, published as today).
- The kinds' check finds no provider's name in this repository's workflows.

## Measured on a local Forgejo

Forgejo 17 and its runner 13.2.0, pinned as the host's forge pins them, with the host's job image `act-24.04` as root and
a JDK mounted as `JAVA_HOME_25_X64`; the registry held the snapshots this Build resolves, copied in from a Maven cache.

- **The red runs, each stopping the Build in turn:** Maven's default http blocker refused a `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL` on
  `http://<host>.localhost` and took the same address on `http://localhost`; the tests of a denied read failed as root,
  which reads through any mode; the image holds no `rpm`, which the package check runs; and `actions/upload-artifact`
  refuses every server but GitHub's. Pi's tree needs a container or the pinned Node: without podman the script left it out and the bill's merge stopped, so *Pi's tree where no container can start* fetches the pinned Node, checked against its digest, and builds it directly.
- **What changed for them:** those tests skip where the account reads through a mode, so they still run on the central
  forge; *The tools the packages are built and read with* installs only what is missing; and the packages are uploaded
  only where `vars.PORELO_PUBLISH` is `true`, since no job on a forge that publishes nothing reads them yet.
- **Green:** the Build, with the `acceptance`, `proof` and `release` jobs skipped, nothing published and every snapshot
  read from the forge's registry.
- **What the central forge sees:** no change. Its image holds the tools, its `PORELO_PUBLISH` is `true`, and its account
  is not root.

## What only a host shows

- The registry through the host's proxy and gate, with `MAVEN_SNAPSHOTS_URL` as the host sets it, and the runner's jobs in
  their own containers rather than in the runner's.
- `porelo`'s, `porelo-parent`'s and `porelo-buildtools`' snapshots deployed there by their own Builds, not copied.
