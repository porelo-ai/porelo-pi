# PI29 — Rename The Adapter Porelo

**Status:** Review.
**Size:** S - one commit made by a script and read through; 766 occurrences in one module, and the build,
the native build and the acceptance as for any change to the adapter.

**What must be true.** The Pi adapter, its repository, its artifact, its packages and its documentation are
named Porelo; nothing a user installs, types or reads from this repository still says Sokar, except where it says
what the old name was.

From [PJ41](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar-project/blob/main/issues/README.md#pj41), where Sokar is renamed
Porelo in one window, every repository by a script its agent runs.

## What carries the name

Counted on `main`, case-insensitive: **766 occurrences in 59 of 70 files, 32 paths**, no binary
file, and no image that draws the name.

- **Paths:** the package directories `org/fuin/sokar/agent/impl/...` under `src/main`, `src/test` and
  `src/acceptance`, and `META-INF/services/org.fuin.sokar.agent.api.Agent`, all moved by `git mv`.
- **Read by others:** the artifact and native executable `sokar-agent-pi`; the packages it
  builds, which `Depends: sokar` and `Provides: sokar-agent` and install into `/usr/libexec/sokar/agents`, where the
  daemon looks; the service file naming Sokar's `Agent` interface; the guide written into every task, which names
  `/sokar/files`. Each follows Sokar's own rename, so they move with it and nothing is kept for the old name:
  Sokar's side is the plain replacement too - `org.fuin.porelo.agent.api.Agent`, `/usr/libexec/porelo/agents`,
  `/porelo/files`, `Provides: porelo-agent`, the token prefix `porelo_pt_`, `PORELO_VAULT`.
- **Read from others:** `org.fuin.sokar` (90 times) - the BOM, `sokar-agent-api`, `sokar-wire`, the acceptance
  kit, the parent, `sokar-release` and `sokar-machines` called by name in the workflows; the properties
  `-Dsokar.release` and `-Dsokar.acceptance.*`; the variables `SOKAR_CI_LEG`, `SOKAR_E2E_EXPECT_CLI`, `SOKAR_E2E_MODEL`, `SOKAR_E2E_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `SOKAR_E2E_REFUSED_KEY`, `SOKAR_RELEASE`, `SOKAR_VAULT`, of which `SOKAR_VAULT` is Sokar's own
  and the CI leg and most of the `SOKAR_E2E_*` set are read by `sokar-machines` and Sokar's acceptance kit. The build
  tools and the parent read the plain replacement as well: `PORELO_CI_LEG`, `PORELO_E2E_*`, `porelo.release.*`,
  `porelo.acceptance.*`. The OpenRouter key comes from the secret `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY`, which keeps its name.
- **At the forge and Artifactory:** the secret `SOKAR_UPDATE_TOKEN` and the variable `SOKAR_UPDATE_AUTO_MERGE`, made
  again as `PORELO_*` in [PJ41](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar-project/blob/main/issues/README.md#pj41)'s preparation; the repositories `sokar-dist-deb` and `sokar-dist-rpm` the workflows
  upload into, and the links to `github.com/sokar-ai/...`.
- **`buildtools/`:** `build-pi-tree.sh` and `follow-upstream.sh` are replaced with the rest, `SOKAR_RELEASE`
  becoming `PORELO_RELEASE`; the SBOM tool's `name` in `buildtools/sbom/package.json` and
  `package-lock.json` changes in both at once, since `npm ci` refuses the two when they disagree.

## Plan

- **Red first:** a test tagged `documents` that lists every tracked file and fails while one says `sokar` in any case
  outside the exceptions below, seen red on today's tree before the script runs, and kept.
- **The script** (`git mv`, then `sokar`/`Sokar`/`SOKAR` to `porelo`/`Porelo`/`PORELO`, then the exceptions put back),
  run and its diff read, then the one thing replacement gets wrong:
  - **the Debian pool's letter:** `pool/main/s/sokar-agent-...` becomes `pool/main/p/porelo-agent-...` in the
    7 places of the workflows that upload to or look into the pool, since the letter is the package's first.
- **Exceptions, the whole list:** the released entries in `CHANGELOG.md` (every section below `[Unreleased]`), which
  stay as released; `0.5.0`'s first entry says the adapter was renamed. And this issue, whole, with the anchor of
  its index row, since it says what the old name was. Nothing else: this repository names nothing outside that
  keeps the old name.
- **Lengths:** `porelo` is one longer; the test tokens `sokar_pt_...` become `porelo_pt_...`, and the tests that
  assert on them are read, not regenerated.
- **Published before this builds**, in this order: `org.fuin.porelo:porelo-parent:0.2.0`, the tools `0.5.0`
  (`porelo-release`, `porelo-machines`), then Porelo's `0.5.0-SNAPSHOT` with its packages in `porelo-dist-deb`
  and `porelo-dist-rpm` for the VM.
- **Checked as any change to the adapter:** unit tests, the native build with its linkage check, the packages, and the
  acceptance on the VM against Porelo installed afresh; then the whole workflow on the renamed repository.

## Acceptance

- The red-first test fails on today's tree and passes on the renamed one, with exactly the exceptions above.
- The packages are named `porelo-agent-...`, install into Porelo's agent directory and are found by `porelo agents`;
  the acceptance passes on the VM against Porelo installed afresh.
- The renamed repository's Build uploads into `porelo-dist-deb` and `porelo-dist-rpm`, at the pool's letter `p`.
